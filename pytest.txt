pytest
==================

it is a testing framework based on python

it is used to write test caes


naming convention
====================

test case file name should start with test

test case method must start with test

execute using pytest


note - if we change method name from test to somthng else
       then it will not execute / work


name of method must start with test


# we can write multiple test cases in a single file



# we can skip execution of  any par test case


# if we want to skip part method 


conditionally skip particulr method


# for more details we need to use verbose 
# -v - verbose 

#  -v


# for execution

we need to write 

pytest -v


# we can pass any substring

# it will execute those test cases which contain sub string



#define sanity nd smoke test cases



# execute particulr group
pytest -m smoke
pytest -m sanity



# pytest fixtures
=============================


execute somthing before test cases

for this we can create fixtures

so that it can execute before each methods


in this method browser is opning again nd again


but if want that browsr will start only once 

scope = "module"


if want to execute somthng aftr executn of methods

we have to use yield
